    <b id="id1">Wonder of Science Essay: </b>

    <p class="p1">
        Looking at the age when a man led a life like a savage, we notice how far we have come. Similarly, <a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/biology/evolution/stages-of-evolution/">the evolution of mankind</a> is truly commendable. One of the major driving forces behind this is science. It makes you think about the wonder of science and how it has proven to be such a boon in our lives. Most importantly, science has helped develop a great civilization. All the advancements that man has been able to make are with the help of science only. However, it won’t be wrong to say that science is a two-edged sword. It comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

    <b id="id2">Advantages of Science:</b>
    
    <p class="p2">To say that science has a lot of benefits would be an understatement. The benefits of science do not just limit to one sphere, but it has proven useful in various spheres of the world. When we talk about innovations in science and engineering, electricity is the first thing that comes to mind. It has helped power the world through its development.</p>

    <p class="p3">That is to say, all the credit goes to science, as it weren’t for science, life in the 21st century would be impossible. After all, it is quite hard to imagine a world without computers, medicines, televisions, AC’s, automobiles and more. In addition, science has contributed largely to the medical field as well.</p>

    <b id="id3">Disadvantages of Science:</b>

    <p class="p4">As the saying goes ‘there is no rainbow without rain’, similarly science has drawbacks of its own. One must always remember that anything in excess is poison, and science is no different. If it falls into evil hands, it can cause destruction on a massive level. For instance, science is used to create nuclear weapons.</p>

    <b id="id4">Conclusion:</b>
    <p class="p5">Therefore, it must be properly used for the greater benefit of mankind. We must ensure the wise use of these scientific inventions in order to save the world from the evil side of science. As Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once stated that science is a beautiful gift to humanity, we must not distort it, likewise, we must live by this quote and monitor the utilization.
